# Portfolio Website

## Description
Hi! This is my portfolio website built to showcase the projects I have built as part of my Fullstack Web Development course with CareerFoundry. 

## Technologies used
- HTML
- CSS 
- Sass

## Skills developed
This is a first attempt at creating a fully functioning website with clear, semantic code and structure. For the styling, I've built a responsive layout that can adapt to varying screen sizes, and have also incorporated an animation for visual interest.
